"""
Puppy is a tool for creating dynamic shell scripts for complex
system configuration.
It perfectly suits situations, where, for some reasons software like
Chef or Puppet cannot be used, and a full configuration
should be carried out.
Puppy glues particular configuration templates and 
produces one configuration file to be executed on a to-be-configured server.
